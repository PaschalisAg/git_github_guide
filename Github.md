# What is Github?
Github is:
1) a website
2) a service that facilitates software development. This is easy to be done on Github since we can store our code in containers (aka *repositories*) and by tracking changes to our code. Moreover, it works as a hosting service and it has tools to build, test, and deploy code.
For all of these features to work properly Github make use of a **version-control development tool**, the famous **Git** (for the commands of Git see, [[Git]]).

# Importance of Github
Github gives you access to a huge community of developers. You and they are able to share their code, projects, and software development tools with each other.
