# Git and GitHub Guide

This repository contains my notes about Git and Github.
The main purpose of it is to make available to the broad audience a "tutorial" on how to work with Github offering tips and explanations of concepts that might be useful when working with Git and Github.
My notes mostly come from the Codecademy course which I should thank for giving me the opportunity of delving into a very useful system and software such as Git and Github.
Of course the notes have been enhanced by me in order to fully grasp some contents. They are nothing more than simple notes, and they should not be used in any research content. I am sure that they contain some mistakes or typos.

You do not need to have anything pre-installed other than a software that can read markdown files.
Move to the directory where you want to save this repository:
`cd {your_path}`

And then run in your Terminal (for MacOS users) or Git Bash (for Windows users):
`git clone https://github.com/PaschalisAg/git_github_guide.git`

And voil√†! Now you have access to the notes. Enjoy the reading and I hope you will find them useful.

If someone wants to contribute to fix these issues or even to enhance the material feel free to email me or open an issue.
